<strong>Oura</strong> is a project meant to allow the creation of a storefront
site dedicated to clothing. It allows the creation of products, categories and
sales with a great degree of customization.

<h1 class="text-2xl">Technologies and Tools</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Next.js</h6>
    <p>
      Next.js was chosen as the framework for the project due to its simplicity
      in developing server-side and client-side components, and its
      industry-wide adoption. This project needed to display a lot of data, for
      which server-side rendering was a great fit, and at the same time, it
      needed to be highly interactive as the user clicked on the products or
      categories. Due to this, Next.js was a great fit for this project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Stripe</h6>
    <p>
      Naturally every storefront needs to have a payment system, and Stripe was
      chosen as the payment provider due to its ease of use and security. This
      project was the first time I used Stripe, and I was able to integrate it
      with Next.js seamlessly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">PostgreSQL</h6>
    <p>
      PostgreSQL was chosen as the database due to its reliability and
      scalability. This project has many related pieces, and it was important to
      have a database that could handle all of these relationships and
      interactions.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
This project was developed single-handedly by myself in 2023. I was responsible
for every facet of it, from design to development. Of note are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Full-Stack Developer</h6>
    <p>
      Implemented the project's functionality and ensuring it was secure and
      scalable. I used Next.js, tRPC, NextAuth.js, and Stripe amongst other
      tools to build the project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">UI/UX Designer</h6>
    <p>
      Designed the user interface and user experience of the project. The
      project wanted to be different from other clothing stores, and I wanted to
      create a unique experience for the user. I used Figma to create the
      designs and implemented them in the project using TailwindCSS.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Challenges and Solutions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Security</h6>
    <p>
      One of the biggest challenges when developing a storefront site is
      security.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help with this, I used NextAuth.js, which provides a simple and secure
      way to handle user authentication and authorization. I also used Stripe to
      handle payments, and Supabase security features to ensure the data was
      safe.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Payment System Implementation</h6>
    <p>
      This was my first time working with any payment system, and I had to
      figure out how to integrate it with the project. I used Stripe. It
      required a bit of setup, but it was somewhat straightforward. I struggled
      a bit more dealing with orders, how to tag them as they were created, how
      to deal with deleted ones, refunds, failed payments, etc. This required a
      lot of research and dealing with edge cases.

</ul>
