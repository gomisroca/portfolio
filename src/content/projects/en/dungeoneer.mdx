<strong>Dungeoneer</strong> is a project meant to keep track of what
collectibles you are missing from dungeons, trials or raids in the game Final
Fantasy XIV. You can either store your collection locally or log in and store it
on your account.

<h1 class="text-2xl">Technologies and Tools</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Next.js</h6>
    <p>
      Next.js was chosen as the framework for the project due to its simplicity,
      ease of use and industry-wide adoption. Furthermore, we knew large parts
      of the project could benefit from server-side rendering, which Next.js
      excels at.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">tRPC</h6>
    <p>
      We expected the project to have a lot of API calls and complex types of
      data, so we decided to use tRPC to handle the communication between the
      client and the server to ensure typesafety and a faster, safer
      development.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">NextAuth.js</h6>
    <p>
      One of the main features of the project is the ability to log in and store
      your collection on your account. To achieve this, we used NextAuth.js,
      which provides a simple and secure way to handle user authentication and
      authorization.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">TailwindCSS + Motion</h6>
    <p>
      Tailwind provided us with a fast and reliable way to style the project.
      However, we wanted to add some animations to certain elements, and we used
      Motion (formerly Framer Motion) to achieve this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Supabase</h6>
    <p>
      Supabase is a cloud-based database that provides a robust and scalable
      solution for storing and retrieving data. We used it to store the in-game
      data, the user's collection and information, and to handle user
      authentication. Furthermore, we use Supabase Buckets to store the images
      of the items.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Vercel</h6>
    <p>
      Since we decided on using Next.js, deploying to Vercel seemed like the
      best, most efficient option. We utilized Vercel's Analytics and Speed
      Insights to ensure the project was running smoothly.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
This project was first developed by a team of three developers in 2022. However,
it was eventually abandoned and I took over the project in 2024 as its sole
developer.
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">UI/UX Designer</h6>
    <p>
      I was responsible for designing the user interface and user experience of
      the project. I used Figma to create the designs and implemented them in
      the project using TailwindCSS and Motion.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Full-Stack Developer</h6>
    <p>
      I was responsible for implementing the project's functionality and
      ensuring it was secure and scalable. I used Next.js, tRPC, NextAuth.js,
      and Supabase amongst other tools to build the project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Project Manager</h6>
    <p>
      As the sole developer, I was responsible for its overall management and
      maintenance. I ensured the project stayed on track, with a focus on core
      features and bug fixes, without letting feature-creep distort the
      project's direction.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Challenges and Solutions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Project Overhaul</h6>
    <p>
      Once I took over as the sole developer, I knew two things: the project was
      unfinished, and the technologies used were outdated. In this initial
      state, it used a simple Angular + MongoDB stack. I decided to use Next.js
      and switch to PostgreSQL, as they seemed to be a better fit for the
      project's requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regard to the frontend, the switch was relatively smooth. The initial
      frontend was not complex, and replicating it in Next.js was somewhat
      straightforward. However, I had to rewrite the entire backend from
      scratch. The database was completely different, as was the API and the
      authentication system.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, I think this complete overhaul was a good decision that has
      led to a more robust and scalable project, with a faster development
      cycle.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">UI Clutter</h6>
    <p>
      One issue I faced while building the UI was clutter. There were too many
      elements on the page, and the layout was not intuitive. At the same time,
      I wanted to keep a clear navigation structure, so users could easily find
      what they were looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
      I decided to simplify the UI: the navigation menu would consist of a few
      buttons linking to the main sections, and a dropdown for other sections
      and options such as login and theme switching.
    </p>
    <p>
      Similarly, item cards were also simplified. Instead of the text writing
      out what type of item it was, or where it came from, I decided to use
      icons to represent this, and use dropdowns to show the item's details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, while there is room for improvement, I believe the current design
      is a good balance between functionality and visual clarity.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
