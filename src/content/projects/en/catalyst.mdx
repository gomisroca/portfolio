<strong>Catalyst</strong> is a project meant to allow collaboritive efforts
blossom into a greater whole. It is a platform where people can collaborate on
projects, and where they can share their ideas and collaborate with others.

<h1 class="text-2xl">Technologies and Tools</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">React</h6>
    <p>
      React was chosen as the framework for the project due to its simplicity,
      industry-wide adoption and strength. This project needed to be highly
      interactive, with many state changes continually happening as the users
      interacted with the site, which made React a great fit for this project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Express</h6>
    <p>
      Express is the go-to framework for building APIs in Node.js. It is a
      lightweight and fast framework that is easy to use and understand. Since
      the backend of this project could become complex, using Express which is
      largely unopinionated and allows for a lot of flexibility was a good fit.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
This project was developed single-handedly by myself in 2023. I was responsible
for every facet of it, from design to development. Of note are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">View Structure</h6>
    <p>
      Designed the way the displayed data would be structured. This was a
      complex task, as the project uses many layers of content, from project, to
      branches, to posts, so it was important to establish a clear hierarchy and
      structure.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Front - Back Communication</h6>
    <p>
      Implemented the project's API endpoints and ensured they were efficient
      and secure. At the same time, I implemented fetch methods in the frontend
      that ensured we only got the data we needed. I used Express, Passport and
      PostgreSQL amongst other tools to achieve this.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Challenges and Solutions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Scope Management</h6>
    <p>
      This was a very ambitious project, and maintaining a clear scope was a
      difficult task. I had to decide which features to prioritize, and which
      ones to drop. In many ocasions I had to stop and reflect on whether a
      certain feature was helpful towards the project's goals, or if it was just
      a distraction. For example, the idea of adding certain 'social media' such
      as comments was dropped, but a timeline was maintained, as it helped with
      the idea of people contribution to projects they were interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, I believe the initial scope of the project as a collaborative
      site was preserved, and the development cycle was smooth and efficient
      thanks to that.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Dockerization</h6>
    <p>
      The project ran into many issues when dealing with dockerization. This was
      one of my first experiences dealing with containers in a full-stack
      project, and I had to troubleshoot and fix many issues. After much trial
      and error and documentation reading, I was able to containerize the
      project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">API Design</h6>
    <p>
      Designing the API was a complex task, as the project had many
      interconnected parts, and it was difficult to know how much information
      each part needed, while also ensuring the API was secure and efficient. In
      my first attempt at this, it was a mess, which worked, but was not very
      scalable or efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      I restructured the API to be more flexible and scalable, with a focus on
      clarity: each endpoint has a clear purpose, a clear input and output, and
      there is no contamination of data between endpoints. This allowed for a
      more efficient and scalable API, that should also be easier to maintain in
      the future.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
