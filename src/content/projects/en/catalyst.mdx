<strong>Catalyst</strong> is a project meant to allow collaboritive efforts
blossom into a greater whole. It is a platform where people can collaborate on
projects, and where they can share their ideas and collaborate with others.

<h1 class="text-2xl">Technologies and Tools</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Next.js</h6>
    <p>
      Next.js was chosen as the framework as we knew large parts of the project
      could benefit from server-side rendering and the server actions the App
      Router provides.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Storybook</h6>
    <p>
      In order to try and mantain a high level of quality and consistency, I
      decided to use Storybook to create a UI library for the project. This
      allowed me to create a set of components that would be used throughout the
      project, and would be stable, easy to use and maintain.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Auth.js</h6>
    <p>
      We knew we would need to implement user authentication and authorization
      for the project, so I decided to use Auth.js, which provides a simple and
      secure way to handle user authentication and authorization. In particular,
      we used magic links to allow a passwordless login experience.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Docker</h6>
    <p>
      Docker was used to containerize the application, ensuring consistency
      across development, staging, and production environments. By packaging the
      app and its dependencies into a single container, we reduced
      environment-specific bugs and made deployment more predictable. It also
      made it easier to collaborate with other developers, as I expected I would
      need help as the project grew in complexity.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">UploadThing</h6>
    <p>
      Uploading images is a common task in the project. To handle this, we
      implemented UploadThing, a lightweight and fast image uploading library,
      which fit our needs perfectly.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">
      React <span className="text-sm text-zinc-500 uppercase">Deprecated</span>
    </h6>
    <p>
      React was chosen as the framework for the project due to its simplicity,
      industry-wide adoption and strength. This project needed to be highly
      interactive, with many state changes continually happening as the users
      interacted with the site, which made React a great fit for this project.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2025, I decided to take a more modern approach to the project, and
      opted to use Next.js App Router.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">
      Express
      <span className="text-sm text-zinc-500 uppercase">Deprecated</span>
    </h6>
    <p>
      Express is the go-to framework for building APIs in Node.js. It is a
      lightweight and fast framework that is easy to use and understand. Since
      the backend of this project could become complex, using Express which is
      largely unopinionated and allows for a lot of flexibility was a good fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2025, Express was replaced by a combination of server actions and API
      routes after the implementation of Next.js App Router.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">
      Nginx <span className="text-sm text-zinc-500 uppercase">Deprecated</span>
    </h6>
    <p>
      Nginx was originally used in this project as a reverse proxy and static
      asset server. It helped improve performance, manage HTTPS termination, and
      handle load balancing during early deployments. This setup gave us more
      control over caching strategies and allowed us to serve the application
      efficiently in a production environment.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2025, Nginx was deprecated as the project migrated to a serverless
      architecture using the Next.js App Router, which handled routing and
      server functions internally.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
This project was developed single-handedly by myself in 2023. In 2025 it
received a near-complete overhaul, with a focus on performance and scalability.
I was responsible for every facet of it, from design to development. Of note
are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">View Structure</h6>
    <p>
      Designed the way the displayed data would be structured. This was a
      complex task, as the project uses many layers of content, from project, to
      branches, to posts, so it was important to establish a clear hierarchy and
      structure.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Front - Back Communication</h6>
    <p>
      Implemented the project's API endpoints and ensured they were efficient
      and secure. At the same time, I implemented fetch methods in the frontend
      that ensured we only got the data we needed. I used Express, Passport and
      PostgreSQL amongst other tools to achieve this.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Challenges and Solutions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Scope Management</h6>
    <p>
      This was a very ambitious project, and maintaining a clear scope was a
      difficult task. I had to decide which features to prioritize, and which
      ones to drop. In many ocasions I had to stop and reflect on whether a
      certain feature was helpful towards the project's goals, or if it was just
      a distraction. For example, the idea of adding certain 'social media' such
      as comments was dropped, but a timeline was maintained, as it helped with
      the idea of people contribution to projects they were interested in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the end, I believe the initial scope of the project as a collaborative
      site was preserved, and the development cycle was smooth and efficient
      thanks to that.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Dockerization</h6>
    <p>
      The project ran into many issues when dealing with dockerization. This was
      one of my first experiences dealing with containers in a full-stack
      project, and I had to troubleshoot and fix many issues. After much trial
      and error and documentation reading, I was able to containerize the
      project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">API Design</h6>
    <p>
      Designing the API was a complex task, as the project had many
      interconnected parts, and it was difficult to know how much information
      each part needed, while also ensuring the API was secure and efficient. In
      my first attempt at this, it was a mess, which worked, but was not very
      scalable or efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      I restructured the API to be more flexible and scalable, with a focus on
      clarity: each endpoint has a clear purpose, a clear input and output, and
      there is no contamination of data between endpoints. This allowed for a
      more efficient and scalable API, that should also be easier to maintain in
      the future.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">2025 Overhaul</h6>
    <p>
      By 2025, I had become much more experienced in the field, and I decided to
      take a look at the project again. However, it quickly became clear it
      would be faster for me to completely restart it, rather than try to
      rewrite parts of it. I decided to take a more modern approach to the
      project, with a focus on performance and scalability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next.js was chosen as the framework. I implemented server actions, API
      endpoints. All of this meant a great deal of 'translating' between the old
      version and the new one. Often, all I could copy from the old version was
      the idea, and had to completely rewrite the implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The result is a much more robust and scalable project, in which I as the
      developer can work with much more efficiency and confidence, and the users
      will have a much better experience.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
