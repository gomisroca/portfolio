<strong>Echoes</strong> is a project meant to be a one-stop collection of
writings. I've always envisioned a different way of finding and financing
writing that fits the online era, and I believe a site where the main parts of a
story are available for free, and the readers can pay for the extras, would be a
great idea.

<h1 class="text-2xl">Technologies and Tools</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Astro</h6>
    <p>
      This is a project focused on content, so Astro seemed like the best fit
      for it. Astro has many features that made the creation of a content-first
      site very simple.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Sanity</h6>
    <p>
      As the idea was to publish new writings regularly, I decided to use a CMS
      (Content Management System) to store the content which would then be
      fetched, instead of a regular database or storing it in the project
      itself. Sanity is an easy to use CMS that integrates perfectly with Astro
      thanks to its official plugin.

  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
This project was developed single-handedly by myself in 2024. I was responsible
for every facet of it, from design to development. Of note are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Content Management</h6>
    <p>
      Designed a system to store and fetch content using Sanity, a CMS. Using
      Sanity's client, I used GraphQL queries to fetch the content, and created
      schemas for the different kinds of data, such as authors and writing
      pieces.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Routing System</h6>
    <p>
      Built the project using Astro and amongst other tasks, developed a routing
      system that would be intuitive and clear for the user, where every piece
      of content was properly categorized, and pieces related to it were easily
      accessible.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Challenges and Solutions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Astro Implementation</h6>
    <p>
      While I was already somewhat familiar with Astro, it was my first time
      using it in a full-fledged project. I had to deal with the fact that
      Astro's syntax is rather different from other frameworks, and I had to
      learn how to use it effectively.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the same time, I had to deal with integrating Sanity, as I found using
      Astro's Content Collections would not be optimal for our use case.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Sanity Implementation</h6>
    <p>
      Sanity is a somewhat easy to use CMS, and it has good integrations with
      Astro thanks to its official plugin. However, I faced some issues with the
      implementation of the CMS, as it was my first time dealing with one. I had
      to deal with the fact that Sanity's client was not very intuitive, the
      queries were verbose and the data was not always easy to fetch.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help with this, I read through the documentation carefully, and
      experimented with different queries to find the best way to fetch the data
      I needed.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
