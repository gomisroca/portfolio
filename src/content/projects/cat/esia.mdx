<strong>Esia</strong> is a project meant to be an online art gallery, where
visitors can view artworks and see what exhibitions and events are happening in
the gallery.

<h1 class="text-2xl">Technologies and Tools</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Next.js</h6>
    <p>
      Knowing there would be plenty of artworks to display, it was decided to
      use Next.js to build the project. Next.js is a framework that allows for
      server-side rendering, which is ideal for this project as it would allow
      for faster loading times and better performance.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">tRPC</h6>
    <p>
      We opted to use tRPC to handle the communication between the client and
      the server, ensuring typesafety and a faster, safer development. This
      decision was based on the fact that we expected to deal with many complex
      types of data, and tRPC was a good fit for this.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Supabase</h6>
    <p>
      Supabase is a cloud-based database that provides a robust and scalable
      solution for storing and retrieving data. With it we stored all of the
      data we need and used its storage features to store the images for the
      many artworks and exhibitions.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Vercel</h6>
    <p>
      Since we decided on using Next.js, deploying to Vercel seemed like the
      best, most efficient option. We utilized Vercel's Analytics and Speed
      Insights to ensure the project was running smoothly.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
This project was developed single-handedly by myself in 2023. I was responsible
for every facet of it, from design to development. Of note are:
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">UI/UX Designer</h6>
    <p>
      Designed a minimalistic and intuitive interface that would allow for easy
      navigation without distracting away from the artworks. Being an art
      gallery, I wanted art to be the main focus when visiting the site. At the
      same time, I used hover and click animations to display the artworks'
      data, which led to bigger, more attractive images.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Full-Stack Developer</h6>
    <p>
      Built the project using Next.js and tRPC, connecting to a PostgreSQL
      database via Prisma. I developed methods to upload images to Supabase
      buckets, to optimize said images for display. Furthermore, I employed
      methods such as pagination to ensure the site was fast and responsive
      despite the large amount of images.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Challenges and Solutions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Image Optimization</h6>
    <p>
      One of the biggest issues I faced during this project was optimizing the
      images for display. With the amount of images the project had, it was
      important to avoid slow loading times.
    </p>
    <p>
      To help with this, I used skeletons while the image was loading,
      pagination to avoid loading too many images at once, and lazy loading to
      only load the images when they are in view.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
