health-oriented products and services to offices.

<h1 class="text-2xl">Technologies and Tools</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Vue</h6>
    <p>
      We settled on Vue as the frontend framework for the project, as it offered
      a flexible and easy-to-use solution for our needs. Vue's declarative
      syntax and component-based architecture made it a great fit for our
      project.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Docker</h6>
    <p>
      Since this was a team project, and we needed to deploy the project to a
      server, we decided to use Docker for the deployment. Docker allowed us to
      create a containerized environment for the project, which made it easier
      for us to maintain the same environment as we developed and on deployment.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Roles and Responsibilities</h1>
Healco project was my first full-fledged project as a developer. I was part of a
team and dealt mainly with the frontend, although I did some backend work as
well.
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Frontend Components and Views</h6>
    <p>
      Designed the frontend part of the project using Vue, including the UI
      components, forms, and views. Also dealt with the styling and layout, and
      dealt with the creation of the navigation system.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">System Health and Monitoring</h6>
    <p>
      Had a small part in building the system monitoring and alerting system, as
      well as the pipeline for the deployment of the project and the creation of
      the Docker image.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h1 class="text-2xl">Challenges and Solutions</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
    <h6 className="text-lg font-semibold">Project Automation and Monitoring</h6>
    <p>
      This project was my first time working with tools such as Sonarqube and
      Ansible, and my first time handling CI/CD pipelines. This was a
      challenging task, but with the help of my team and after reading a lot of
      documentation, the project was successfully deployed, monitored, and
      accessible.
